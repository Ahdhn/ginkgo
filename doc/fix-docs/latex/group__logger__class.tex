The \hyperlink{classgko_1_1log_1_1Logger}{Logger} class represents a simple \hyperlink{classgko_1_1log_1_1Logger}{Logger} object.  


The \hyperlink{classgko_1_1log_1_1Logger}{Logger} class represents a simple \hyperlink{classgko_1_1log_1_1Logger}{Logger} object. 

It comprises all masks and events internally. Every new logging event addition should be done here. The \hyperlink{classgko_1_1log_1_1Logger}{Logger} class also provides a default implementation for most events which do nothing, therefore it is not an obligation to change all classes which derive from \hyperlink{classgko_1_1log_1_1Logger}{Logger}, although it is good practice. The logger class is built using event masks to control which events should be logged, and which should not.
