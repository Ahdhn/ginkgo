Here you can find Examples programs that demonstrate the usage of Ginkgo.

Some examples are built on another and some are stand-\/alone and demonstrate a concept of Ginkgo, which can be used in your own code.

You can browse the available example programs 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item as {\bfseries \href{#graph}{\tt a graph}} that shows how example programs build upon each other. 
\item as {\bfseries \href{#list}{\tt a list}} that provides a short synopsis of each program. 
\item or {\bfseries \href{#topic}{\tt grouped by topic}}. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The easiest way to build the example that you want is to use the script provided\+: {\ttfamily ./build.sh P\+A\+T\+H\+\_\+\+T\+O\+\_\+\+G\+I\+N\+K\+G\+O\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+D\+IR }

By default, Ginkgo is compiled with atleast {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+G\+I\+N\+K\+G\+O\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+R\+E\+F\+E\+R\+E\+N\+CE=on}. To execute on a G\+PU, you need to have a G\+PU on the system and must have compiled Ginkgo with the {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+G\+I\+N\+K\+G\+O\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+C\+U\+DA=on} option.

Alternatively, you can setup the configuration manually\+:

Go to the {\ttfamily  P\+A\+T\+H\+\_\+\+T\+O\+\_\+\+G\+I\+N\+K\+G\+O\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+D\+IR } directory and copy the shared libraries located in the following subdirectories\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily core/} 
\item {\ttfamily core/device\+\_\+hooks/} 
\item {\ttfamily reference/} 
\item {\ttfamily omp/} 
\item {\ttfamily cuda/} 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}to this directory.

Then compile the file with the following command line\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
c++ -\hyperlink{namespacestd}{std}=c++11 -o example-* example-*.cpp -I../.. \(\backslash\)
-L. -lginkgo -lginkgo\_reference -lginkgo\_omp -lginkgo\_cuda
\end{DoxyCode}
 (if ginkgo was built in debug mode, append \textquotesingle{}d\textquotesingle{} to every library name)

Now you should be able to run the program using\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
env LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=.:$\(\backslash\)\{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH\(\backslash\)\} ./example-*
\end{DoxyCode}
