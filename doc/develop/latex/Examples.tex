Here you can find example programs that demonstrate the usage of Ginkgo. Some examples are built on one another and some are stand-\/alone and demonstrate a concept of Ginkgo, which can be used in your own code.

You can browse the available example programs 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item as {\bfseries{\href{\#graph}{\texttt{ a graph}}}} that shows how example programs build upon each other. 
\item as {\bfseries{\href{\#list}{\texttt{ a list}}}} that provides a short synopsis of each program. 
\item or {\bfseries{\href{\#topic}{\texttt{ grouped by topic}}}}. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

By default, all Ginkgo examples are built using C\+Make.

An example for building the examples and using Ginkgo as an external library without C\+Make can be found in the script provided for each example, which should be called with the form\+: {\ttfamily ./build.sh P\+A\+T\+H\+\_\+\+T\+O\+\_\+\+G\+I\+N\+K\+G\+O\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+D\+IR }

By default, Ginkgo is compiled with at least {\ttfamily -\/D\+G\+I\+N\+K\+G\+O\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+R\+E\+F\+E\+R\+E\+N\+CE=ON}. To execute on a G\+PU, you need to have a G\+PU on the system and must have compiled Ginkgo with the {\ttfamily -\/D\+G\+I\+N\+K\+G\+O\+\_\+\+B\+U\+I\+L\+D\+\_\+\+C\+U\+DA=ON} option.
