/**
 * @page Examples Example programs
 *
 * Here you can find Examples programs that demonstrate the usage of Ginkgo.
 * Some examples are built on another and some are stand-alone and demonstrate a concept of
 * Ginkgo, which can be used in your own code.
 *
 * You can browse the available example programs
 * <ol>
 *   <li> as <b><a href="#graph">a graph</a></b> that shows how example programs build upon each other.
 *   <li> as <b><a href="#list">a list</a></b> that provides a short
 *     synopsis of each program.
 *   <li> or <b><a href="#topic">grouped by topic</a></b>.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The programs are in the <code>examples/</code> directory of your local
 * Ginkgo installation. To compile the examples during the compilation of the library,
 * you can pass the `-DGINKGO_BUILD_EXAMPLES = ON` to the cmake command. It is `ON` by default.
 * After compiling the library itself, if you go into
 * one of the example directories, you can configure the program by typing
 * <code>cmake .</code>, build it via <code>make</code> and run it using
 * <code>make run</code>.
