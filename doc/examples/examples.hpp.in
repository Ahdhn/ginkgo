/**
 * @page Examples Example programs
 *
 * Here you can find Examples programs that demonstrate the usage of Ginkgo.
 * Some examples are built on another and some are stand-alone and demonstrate a concept of
 * Ginkgo, which can be used in your own code.
 *
 * You can browse the available example programs
 * <ol>
 *   <li> as <b><a href="#graph">a graph</a></b> that shows how example programs build upon each other.
 *   <li> as <b><a href="#list">a list</a></b> that provides a short
 *     synopsis of each program.
 *   <li> or <b><a href="#topic">grouped by topic</a></b>.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The easiest way to build the example that you want is to use the script provided:
 * <code>./build.sh PATH_TO_GINKGO_BUILD_DIR </code>
 *
 * By default, Ginkgo is compiled with atleast <code>-DGINKGO_BUILD_REFERENCE=on</code>.
 * To execute on a GPU, you need to have a GPU on the system and must have
 * compiled Ginkgo with the <code>-DGINKGO_BUILD_CUDA=ON</code> option.
 *
 * Alternatively, you can setup the configuration manually:
 *
 * Go to the <code> PATH_TO_GINKGO_BUILD_DIR </code> directory and copy the shared
 * libraries located in the following subdirectories:
 * <ol>
 *   <li> <code>core/</code>
 *   <li> <code>core/device_hooks/</code>
 *   <li> <code>reference/</code>
 *   <li> <code>omp/</code>
 *   <li> <code>cuda/</code>
 * </ol>
 * to this directory.
 *
 * Then compile the file with the following command line:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * c++ -std=c++11 -o example-* example-*.cpp -I../.. \
 * -L. -lginkgo -lginkgo_reference -lginkgo_omp -lginkgo_cuda
 * @endcode
 * (if ginkgo was built in debug mode, append 'd' to every library name)
 *
 * Now you should be able to run the program using:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:\$\{LD_LIBRARY_PATH\} ./example-*@endcode
 *
 * <a name="graph"></a>
 * @anchor ExampleConnectionGraph
 * <h3>Connections between example programs</h3>
 *
 * The following graph shows the connections between example programs and
 * how they build on each other.
 * Click on any of the boxes to go to one of the programs. If you hover
 * your mouse pointer over a box, a brief description of the program
 * should appear.
