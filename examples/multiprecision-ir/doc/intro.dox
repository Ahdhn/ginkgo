<a name="Multiprecision Iterative Refinement"></a>
<h1>This example manually implements a multiprecision iterative refinement solver.</h1>

<h3> In this example, we first read in a matrix from file, then generate a
right-hand side and an initial guess. An inaccurate CG solver in single precision
is used as the inner solver to an iterative refinement (IR) in double precision
method which solves a linear system.
