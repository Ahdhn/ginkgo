/* A bit complicated for now, but this is how to build it:
 *
 * Ginkgo should be compiled with `-DBUILD_REFERENCE=on` option.
 * Once you built ginkgo, go to the build directory and copy the shared
 * libraries located in the following subdirectories:
 *     + core/
 *     + core/device_hooks/
 *     + reference/
 * to this directory.
 *
 * Then compile this file with the following command line:
 *
 * c++ -o test test.cpp -I.. -L. -lginkgo -lginkgo_reference -lginkgo_cpu \
 *     -lginkgo_gpu
 *
 * (if ginkgo was built in debug mode, append 'd' to every library name)
 * Now you should be able to run the program with
 *
 * LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./test
