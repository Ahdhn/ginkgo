 * FCG or the flexible conjugate gradient method is an iterative type Krylov
 * subspace method which is suitable for symmetric positive definite methods.
 *
 * Though this method performs very well for symmetric positive definite
 * matrices, it is in general not suitable for general matrices.
 *
 * In contrast to the standard CG based on the Polack-Ribiere formula, the
 * flexible CG uses the Fletcher-Reeves formula for creating the orthonormal
 * vectors spanning the Krylov subspace. This increases the computational cost
 * of every Krylov solver iteration but allows for non-constant preconditioners.
 *
 * The implementation in Ginkgo makes use of the merged kernel to make the best
 * use of data locality. The inner operations in one iteration of FCG are
 * merged into 2 separate steps.
