/**
 * The Error class is used to report exceptional behaviour in library
 * functions. MAGMA-sparse uses C++ exception mechanism to this end, and the
 * Error class represents a base class for all types of errors. The exact list
 * of errors which could occur during the execution of a certain library
 * routine is provided in the documentation of that routine, along with a short
 * description of the situation when that error can occur.
 * During runtime, these errors can be detected by using standard C++ try-catch
 * blocks, and a human-readable error description can be obtained by calling
 * the Error::what() method.
 *
 * As an example, trying to compute a matrix-vector product with arguments of
 * incompatible size will result in a DimensionMismatch error, which is
 * demonstrated in the following program.
 *
 * ```cpp
 * #include <ginkgo.h>
 * #include <iostream>
 *
 * using namespace gko;
 *
 * int main()
 * {
 *     auto cpu = create<CpuExecutor>();
 *     auto A = randn_fill<CsrMatrix<float>>(5, 5, 0f, 1f, cpu);
 *     auto x = fill<DenseMatrix<float>>(6, 1, 1f, cpu);
 *     try {
 *         auto y = apply(A.get(), x.get());
 *     } catch(Error e) {
 *         // an error occured, write the message to screen and exit
 *         std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
 *         return -1;
 *     }
 *     return 0;
 * }
