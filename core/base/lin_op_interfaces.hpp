/**
 * ConvertibleTo interface is used to mark that the implementer can be converted
 * to the object of ResultType.
 *
 * This interface is used to enable conversions between different LinOp types.
 * Let `A` and `B` be two LinOp subclasses. To mark that objects of type `A` can
 * be converted to objects of type `B`, `A` should implement the
 * `ConvertibleTo\<B\>` interface. Then the following code:
 *
 * ```c++
 * auto a = A::create(...);
 * auto b = B::create(...);
 *
 * b->copy_from(a.get());
 *
 * ```
 *
 * will convert object `a` to object `b` as follows:
 *
 * 1.  `B::copy_from()` checks that LinOp `a` can be dynamically casted to
 *     `ConvertibleTo\<B\>` (i.e. a can be converted to type `B`)
 * 2.  `B::copy_from()` internally calls `ConvertibleTo\<B\>::convert_to(B*)`
 *     on `a` to complete the conversion.
 *
 * In case `a` is passed in as a unique_ptr (i.e. using
 * `b->copy_from(std::move(a));`) call to `convert_to` will be replaced by a
 * call to `move_to` and trigger move semantics.
 *
 * @tparam ResultType  the type to which the implementer can be converted to

 * ------------------------------------

 * //Transposing an object of LinOp type.
 * //The object you want to transpose.
 * std::unique_ptr<LinOp> op = matrix::Csr::create(exec);
 * //Transpose the object by first converting it to a transposable type.
 * auto trans = as<Transposable>(op.get())->transpose();
 * //This returns the object of type LinOp, and needs to be cast to the
