 * on different executors, and that they can be copied between those executors.

/**
 * The EnablePolymorphicObject mixin provides a default implementation of
 * PolymorphicObject for a concrete polymorphic object.
 *
 * Think of it as an extension of default constructor/destructor/assignment
 * operators. In more detail, this mixin implements all PolymorphicObject's
 * pure virtual methods by using the objects constructors and assignment
 * operators. In addition, it hides appropriate PolymorphicObject's default
 * non-virtual methods with variants that use `ConcreteObject` as return type
 * instead of the generic PolymorphicObject. This simplifies the management of
 * polymorphic objects, as calls like `object->clone()` will return an object
 * with the same static type as the source object.
 *
 * As a result, creating a new PolymorphicObject requires that the implementer
 * only inherits from `EnablePolymorphicObject` and implement an _executor
 * default constructor_ to obtain a fully functional PolymorphicObject:
 *
 * ```c++
 * struct MyObject : EnablePolymorphicObject<MyObject> {
 *     MyObject(std::shared_ptr<const Executor> exec)
 *         : EnablePolymorphicObject<MyObject>(std::move(exec))
 *     {}
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * Consequently, when implementing new polymorphic objects, users are encouraged
 * to use this class as the base implementation, and override (or hide) some of
 * its methods if necessary.
 *
 * @tparam ConcreteObject  the concrete object for which the PolymorphicObject
 *                         interface is to be implemented
 * @tparam PolymorphicBase  the direct base class of ConcreteObject (has to be
 *                          a subclass of PolymorphicObject)
