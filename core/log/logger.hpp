 * derive from Logger, although it is good practice.
 * The logger class is built using event masks to control which events should be
 * logged, and which should not.

 * @internal The class uses bitset to facilitate picking a combination of events
 * to logs. In addition, the class design allows to not propagate empty messages
 * for events which are not tracked.
